# INTRODUCTION TO AI/ML
- ML is a subset of AI.
- AI is the meta domain that encompasses several specialized domains of learning designed to address specific tasks and challenges.  
- This includes Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Generative AI, Computer Vision, Expert Systems, Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, Robotics and more.
- The focus of study in this repo is Machine Learning, and Deep Learning to some extent.

# INTRODUCTION TO ML 
- Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that involves studying and developing statistical models and algorithms that enable machines to make decisions based on trained data.
- At a broad level, ML algorithms can be classified into three categories:
  - <b>Supervised Learning</b>
  - <b>Unsupervised Learning</b>
  - <b>Reinforcement Learning</b>

### Supervised Learning
- Supervised Learning deals with problems when the problem statement clearly defines what needs to be done. (predicted)
- Supervised models learn with labelled data.
- The variable or outcome that needs to be predicted is known as the **predictor** **variable** or **dependent variable** **(y)**.
- The other fields in the dataset are called **features** or **independent variables** **(x)**.

- Applications of Supervised Learning Algorithms:
  - Customer Churn Prediction (Classification)
  - Bank Credit Card Fraud Detection (Classification)
  - Email/SMS Spam Detection (Classification)
  - Regression Problems

 ### Unsupervised Learning
 - Unsupervised learning problems do not have a predictor variable.
 - Unsupervised models learn exclusively through unlabelled data. (It could be weak or semi-supervised as well).
 - Applications of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:
   - Clustering Algorithms
   - Principal Component Analysis
   - Recommendation Systems

### Reinforcement Learning
- Teaches AI systems to make decisions through trial and error.
- Applicable in game systems, such as chess or other strategic games.
- For Instance:
  We beat the game bot using **x strategic steps** in an online game such as chess. The game could not be beaten with the same **x strategic steps** again, since the game evolves through reinforcement learning.

_Please note that **accuracy** is not the recommended metric for the evaluation of performance of a machine learning model._
