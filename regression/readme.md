# Classification in ML (Supervised)

- Regression is a supervised learning technique in machine learning that aims to predict the value of a continuously varying numerical quantity. 
- The values predicted by a regression function are compared against their true values. The difference between them is termed **loss** or **error**.
- The loss or error is calculated using the **loss function** of the regression algorithm.
- Regression algorithms aim to minimize this loss and derive a generalized model that prevents **underfitting** or **overfitting**.
