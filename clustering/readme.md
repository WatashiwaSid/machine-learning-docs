# Clustering
- Clustering is a technique of unsupervised machine learning where each data point is recognized into a cluster (a group) based on some mutual characteristics. 
- This is different than classification because we are making clusters, not predicting new data points in those clusters.
- Clustering could either be **hard** or **soft**.

## Hard Clustering
- In hard clustering, each data point belongs to one and only one cluster.
- A data point must belong to 1 and only one cluster.
- The are no overlapping clusters.
- Example - **K-Means Clustering** , **K-Medoids Clustering**.

## Soft Clustering
- In soft clustering, a data point could belong to more than 1 cluster at a time.
- Data points share a degree of relationships with clusters based on probability.
- Overlapping clusters are possible.
- Example - **Fuzzy C Means Clustering**, **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
