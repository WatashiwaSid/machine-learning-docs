# Classification in ML (Supervised)

- Classification in machine learning is a supervised learning technique in which the goal is to predict the category or class of an instance based on its features.
- This involves training a model on a dataset that includes instances or observations already labeled with classes, and then using that model to classify new, unseen instances into one of the predefined categories.
